Description: collection of audio handling programs
 Python Audio Tools are a collection of audio handling programs
 which work from the command line.
 These include programs for CD extraction,
 track conversion from one audio format to another,
 track renaming and retagging, track identification,
 CD burning from tracks, and more.
 Supports internationalized track filenames and metadata using Unicode. 
 Works with high-definition, multi-channel audio as well as CD-quality. 
 Track conversion uses multiple CPUs or CPU cores if available
 to greatly speed the transcoding process.
 Track metadata can be retrieved from FreeDB,
 MusicBrainz or compatible servers.
